## Flutter Stopwatch App

A topwatch application built with Flutter, following clean architecture principles. This project demonstrates state management using the BLoC library, testing, and modular design for scalable Flutter apps.

The project template was generated with the *very_good_cli* (v0.27.0) and was developed Flutter 3.35.3. 

## Features

- **Stopwatch Functionality**: Start, pause, stop, and record laps with millisecond precision.
- **Multiple Clock Displays**: Digital and analog clock widgets for flexible UI.
- **State Management**: Bloc pattern.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of data, domain, and presentation layers.
- **Testing**:
    - Unit, widget, and integration tests
    - Custom robots and fakes for UI and business logic coverage
- **Platform Support**: Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Windows

The `packages/` directory contains shared Flutter packages for modularity and code reuse. Each package is intended to be reused across multiple apps inside an organisation - either in a *monorepo* setup like in this project - or *published separately* for easy dependency handling. 

- **core/**: Shared core logic, widgets etc. It is supposed to contain all logic, themes and reusable atomic components that implement the organisation's UI style guidelines
- **utils/**: Common utilities, constants, extensions, and error handling used across multiple apps and features.

## Project Structure

- **The project follows a *feature-first* clean architecture style and uses flavors.**

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/ZsoltFischer/Flutter-Stopwatch.git
     cd Flutter-Stopwatch
     ```
2. **Install dependencies**
     ```sh
     flutter pub get
     ```
3. **Run the app**
     ```sh
     flutter run --flavor <flavor> --target lib/main_<flavor>.dart
     ```
4. **Run tests**
     - Unit/Widget tests:
         ```sh
         flutter test
         ```
     - Integration tests (requires emulator/device):
         ```sh
         flutter test integration_test --flavor <flavor> integration_test/app_test.dart
         ```

## Testing Approach

- **Unit Tests**: Validate business logic and state transitions.
- **Widget Tests**: Verify UI rendering and interaction in `test/feature/stopwatch/presentation/widgets/`.
- **Integration Tests**: Use `integration_test/app_robot.dart` for complex workflows and end-to-end scenarios.
- **Test Helpers**: Custom fakes, robots, and pump helpers for maintainable tests.

## Architecture

- **Feature-first**
-- **Data Layer**: Handles data sources, models, and repository implementations.
-- **Domain Layer**: Contains entities, repository interfaces, services, and use cases.
-- **Presentation Layer**: Manages UI, Bloc state, and widget composition.

## Localization

- ARB files in `lib/l10n/arb/` for supported languages
- Generated localization classes in `lib/l10n/gen/`

## Getting Started üöÄ

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Stopwatch works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

---

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ very_good test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:stopwatch/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```

### Generating Translations

To use the latest translations changes, you will need to generate them:

1. Generate localizations for the current project:

```sh
flutter gen-l10n --arb-dir="lib/l10n/arb"
```

Alternatively, run `flutter run` and code generation will take place automatically.
